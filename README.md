# Intelligent big data analytics technologies for creating a guide to functional food ingredients

Determination of umami flavor intensity is an important task in order to improve product quality, for example, replacing chemically synthesized additives with additives of natural origin. To solve this problem, a cascade algorithm based on CatBoost and BERT was developed. The functionality of the algorithm can be found at the following [link](https://taste.infochemistry.ru).

The working principle of the algorithm is shown in the figure below. The desired intensity is fed to the input of the algorithm. The output n is the number of peptides that are closest to the given initial value.
